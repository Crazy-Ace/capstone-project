# Capstone Project

Project #5 for the [Udacity Senior Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/senior-web-developer-nanodegree--nd802)

<!-- Passed on ??? ðŸ”¥ -->

## Project Description

You must create your very own web application that functions just as a native mobile application would, using all that youâ€™ve learned throughout this Nanodegree program.

## Project Requirements

- **Responsive Design** - App is equally functional on mobile and desktop, using responsive design to ensure its displayed in a useable state.
- **Input Design** - All form inputs have appropriate types, labels, placeholders, and immediately validated.
- **Implement Offline Functionality** - Application defaults to offline-first functionality, functioning if a network connection does not exist.
- **Meets Accessibility Standards** - All images have alternative text, focus is appropriately managed, elements are semantically used appropriately. When semantic elements are not used, ARIA roles are properly applied. Colors and contrast are managed.
- **Component Use and Design** - If components are used, they are self-contained units of functionality and declaratively configurable.
- **Home Screen Installable** - The application is installable to userâ€™s home screen.
- **Built for the Progressive Web** - Application uses native features, like push notifications, Bluetooth, geolocation, as appropriate for the application.
- **App Delivery: Build Process** - App includes a build process (such as Grunt or Gulp). Assets are minimized and concatenated as appropriate.
